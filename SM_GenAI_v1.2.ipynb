            "* **Spot Treatment:** Apply a spot treatment with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to individual pimples.\n",
            "* **Moisturizer:**  Use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer.\n",

            "* **Eat a healthy diet:**  Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and dairy products, which can contribute to acne.\n",
            "* **Manage stress:**  Stress can trigger acne breakouts. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature.\n",
