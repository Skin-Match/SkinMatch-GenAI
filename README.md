# SkinMatch-GenAI
SkinMatch-GenAI utilizes Google Cloud Platform's Vertex AI to generate high-quality outputs based on input prompts. This project demonstrates the capabilities of generative AI in producing accurate and detailed results.

The model generated by Vertex AI undergoes modifications to align with stakeholder requirements. Users can input their skin type, skin concerns, and current skincare routine as parameters for the model.
